'going through all the types of Variables for VBA

Option Explicit 'This means that all the variables must be declare, i.e. use cons or dim

Sub variables()

' Single line Declaration
Dim int3 As Integer, int1 As Integer, int2 As Integer, date1 As Date
    ' different types of assignments can be on the same line


Dim int6, int7, int10 As Integer
    ' in this case int6 and int 7 will be stored (by default) as a variant
    
    
'Constant Variables, for variables that will never change
'Constant replaces dim, and you can only assign it once

Const num As Integer = 9

' Other types of variables (~10 data types) small to large

    Dim var_byte As Byte 'this can store number 0-255 ---> of Byte Memory
        var_byte = 255
        'var_byte = 256 warning this will cause overflow error
        
    Dim var_boolean As Boolean 'this can "true" (non-zero), takes up 2 Bytes of Memory up to 555
        var_boolean = False 'put another number and it will be True
        
    Dim var_integer As Integer 'can store numbers -32,768 to 32,767
        var_integer = 6 'can't have a decimal or it will round according
        
    Dim var_long As Long 'this store numbers that are very long ---> 4 butes of memory -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,648
        'when ever you are working on rows and columns, use the Long variable
        '
        
    Dim var_currency As Currency 'Currency - this can store numbers very large -922,337,203,685,477.5808 to -922,337,203,685,477.5808 (8 bytes of memory)
    
    
    Dim var_Double As Single
    
    Dim var_single As Double
    
    Dim var_date As Date 'store dates January 1, 0100 to December 31, 9999 8 byes of memory
        var_date = "12/31/999"
        
    Dim var_string As String 'this can hold 0 to 2 billion characters ---> 10 Bytes of Memory
        var_string = "my names is name"
        
    Dim variant_string As Variant 'this can store number up to data type double or characters, is flexible '22 bites
        'important because if you don't declare a variable
        'every variable that you don't declare will be very big and will slow down your memory

'Naming conventions:
    'can't use anything that VBA needs to use run or store
    'no spaces in variables
    'capatilize start of each word in variable
    'stay in range of varaible assignment
    
'Rmemeber
    ' declare variables so memory isn't boggeed down
    ' use dim to declare and choose the correct type
